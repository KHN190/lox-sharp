## What is this for?

My personal goal is to implement a Lox VM in C# following this fantastic book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I have never managed to finish any compiler books, and internet resources are never satisfying. I have no idea how could our beloved Bob make the book so fun, but I promise you it is a book worth investing time.

## How do I Run?

It is an interpreter,

```bash
# this will compile and run it
dotnet run
```

## Devlog

* 2019.12.25 Christmas day, release lox scanner.

## License

I don't know much about license, but I know MIT is good.
