## What is this for?

My personal goal is to implement a Lox interpreter in C# and later a VM in C++, following this fantastic book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I never managed to finish a compiler book before, but Bob's book is the best!

## How do I Run?

It is an interpreter,

```bash
# this will compile and run it
dotnet run
```

## Devlog

* 2019.12.25 Christmas day, release lox scanner.
* 2020.4.12 release lox interpreter for expressions.

## License

I know MIT is good so I use it.
