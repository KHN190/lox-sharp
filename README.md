## What is this for?

My personal goal is to implement a Lox interpreter in C# and later a VM in C++ (I may also want to do it in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)...), following the fantastic book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I never managed to finish a compiler book, but Bob's book is the best!

## How do I Run?

It is an interpreter,

```bash
# this will compile and run it
dotnet run
# or run a script
dotnet run ./scripts/hello.lox
```
